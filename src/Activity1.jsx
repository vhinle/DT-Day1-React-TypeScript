    The objectives here are 
      - to convert the component Part1 to be a default export arrow function called Part1Answer (use const instead of function keyword).
      - Just copy the return statement as is in the new function. 
      - The answers to the following are written in the new arrow function:
        - to destructure the userAgent and language key from the navigator object
        - to destructure the console.log() function into log() only
        - to destructure the CAD_USD_EURO_EXCHANGE into 3 variables: 
          cadFx, usdFx, and euroFx (in that exact order in the array)
            - tip: use let instead of const
        - to swap the values of usdFx and euroFx without using new variable names
        - use the created log function to log cadFx, usdFx, and euroFx in this format:
          "1 Canadian Dollar to PHP is 40.56, 1 US Dollar to PHP is 56.21, 1 Euro to PHP is 63.96"
            -tip: use string interpolation instead of having multiple parameters in the log function.
